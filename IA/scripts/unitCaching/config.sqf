	Title: Script Configuration
	Author: Dylan Plecki (Naught)
	
	Notes:
		To disable caching on a per-unit basis, put this code in its init:
			this setVariable ["cacheObject", false, true];
		Caching may break scripts which count units (such as scripts which
		monitor AI counts for the mission ending), and distribution may
		break scripts which modify AI behaviour (such as UPSMON). To fix
		this, one may use the "CACHE_UNIT_SPAWN_FNC" definition to define
		a function to load and process on every cached unit spawn, such as:
			{_this call MY_fnc_unitSpawn;} // _this == _spawnedObject
		Where "MY_fnc_unitSpawn" contains code with differentiates between
		vehicles and units and runs scripts accordingly (ie. UPSMON).
